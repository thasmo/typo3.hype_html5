Introduction
What does it do?
Hype HTML5 focuses on teaching TYPO3 how to render HTML5-friendly markup. Besides that it provides some functionality to ease the development of HTML5-powered websites.
Hype HTML5 is a complete replacement for css_styled_content. It is responsible for rendering all content elements and plugins in the website frontend.
Features
Rendering HTML5-friendly markup in the frontend.
Integration of normalize.css for consistent cross browser rendering.
Integration of several recommended JavaScript helpers like modernizr, seletivizr and respond.js.
Custom namespace configuration for the <html/> element.
Provide the chrome frame installer for Internet Explorer version 7 and below.
Administration
1. Import and install the extension.
2. Include the static TypoScript template files.
3. Adapt the configuration to your needs.
FAQ
1. Is it needed to import the static TypoScript file from the extension css_styled_content?
No, you should not include the static TypoScript file of css_styled_content.
2. Is it possible to uninstall the extension css_styled_content?
Yes, css_styled_content is not needed at all. It's up to you if you want to uninstall it.
Maybe it's needed by some other extensions, but Hype HTML5 does not need it.
3. Does the order of installation matter?
Yes, it does matter. If you have installed css_styled_content, Hype HTML5 needs to be installed after it. Extension which are rendered in the frontend should be installed after Hype HTML5. You can check and edit the order of installation in /typo3conf/localconf.php on your own risk, if needed.
4. Does this extension extend the tt_content TypoScript configuration?
No, it brings its own, totally new tt_content configuration, which may not be compatible to some other extensions which modify the tt_content TypoScript configuration.
5. Which browser versions are compatible?
All modern, A-grade browsers should be compatible.
Internet Explorer is supported from version 8 and upwards.
