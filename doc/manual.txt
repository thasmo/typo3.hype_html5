Introduction
What does it do?
Hype HTML5 enables TYPO3 to render valid and semantically correct HTML markup. Besides that it provides some neat features to spice up specific HTML elements, like a feature to define namespaces for the HTML element.
Administration
Installation
1. Import and install the extension.
2. Include the static typoscript template files.
3. Adapt the configuration to your needs.
Note
You may not include the static typoscript template files from the extension css_styled_content.
To fully enable HTML5 capabilities you need to configure config.doctype with the value html5.

Modernizr
Hype HTML5 includes a small, custom modernizr build, which helps to have a better HTML5 experience for all browsers. Modernizr uses a HTML5 shim to enable IE6 to style unknown HTML5 elements. Modernizr was built with the following features enabled: iepp, respond, mq, cssclasses, teststyles, load. If you need more features, it’s recommended to configure your own build and use it instead of the one which comes with Hype HTML5.
To use your own Modernizr build you just need to include it as a JS library via TypoScript. Hype HTML5 checks the included JS libraries and if one library is called ‘modernizr’ it won’t include the own build. Another way is to disable the inclusion of the modernizr build, setting common.enableScript to 0 and including your own build.
